			<h1>Project Reflection Questions</h1>
			<p>In studio this week, we were asked to reflect on the current state and upcoming plans for our projects. We were guided to this this by answering questions from lecturer Sergio Uruena who has given us a talk about a quest for responsible innovation.My head has been extremely clouded lately. I am not sure exactly in which direction to head, or where my project lies. Because of this, it made it very difficult to answer the questions that Sergio Uruena laid out for us as I feel they are very pointed and aimed towards a specified project. Below, I have listed out future desires for possible projects and interventions. For now, they will serve as the basis of thoughts for which I answer the following questions, some being more complete than others.</p>
<p>- Creating dyes with bacteria, using bacteria to break down harmful dies</p>
<p>- 3D printing with waste material: oyster shells</p>
<p>- Creating solar photovoltaic panels with food waste- wearable, charging accessories</p>
<p>- Bioremediating with algal systems</p>

&nbsp
<p>What do I know and not know about my own project? What assumptions, interests, values underpin my project and to what extent have I reflected on them?</p>
<p>	These project ideas are all relatively new to me, though the concepts encompassing them have been floating around in my head for a while. I haven’t reflected much on the assumptions or values that underpin my project goals. Due to the amount of general reflection we do in the MDEF course, however, I do have a clear idea of why I am interested in these topics and why I find them important. I am still in the beginning research phases of the ideas and need to learn more about them at a scientific and technical level.</p>
&nbsp
<p>Am I committed enough to my project and to the community with(in) and for which I am co-developing it?</p>
	<p>I feel I am deeply committed in the way that I care about these topics and believe in what they can do for improving technologies in the realm of sustainable design that is forward-thinking and collaborative. The challenge lies in finding the exact community itself, how I can bring these big topics closer to home and within barcelona. By working with living systems, it is a different kind of community. However, there is always a human aspect that must be added as we humans are the ones designing these systems in the first place.</p>
&nbsp
<p>In what sense am I corresponding to an interest, a need or an expectation of the socio-technical system or community in which I feel involved?</p>
<p>	By using living species of algae and bacteria, and considering them as a community, I would be using their power for the betterment of society due to anthropogenic problems. There is a need, along with growing interest, in fabrication with biological systems and harnessing their abilities, coupled with design innovations for informed solutions based on natural systems.</p>
&nbsp
<p>To what extent do I welcome and promote diversity and could adapt my project if new needs or demands arise? (How adaptable can my project be to possible changes?)</p>
<p>	Adaptability is something that I value a lot. I hope that I can be open to any changes in the project. Especially when working with natural systems, things are not always directly in your control and there are many variables which I don’t always know how will change/act. I also know that with these topics, I may be bound to the scientific knowledge I have or resources in terms of things like bio labs that I have around me. Therefore, I would need to be creative and adaptable in how I can still bring these projects to life.</p>
&nbsp
<p>Could my project be applied in other contexts /by other actors? What could be the future consequences?</p>
<p>	I think each of these projects would have to somewhat be interdisciplinary, with aspects of science, technology, and design. Therefore, many different groups/actors could play a part. With this, it could be taken in many different directions.</p>
&nbsp
<p>What futures am I promoting and who might benefactor be disadvantaged? (How desirable are the futures I am promoting with my project, and for whom?</p>
<p>	With everything I do with mdef, I am aiming to promote futures that are more sustainable, more egalitarian, more responsible, more fair for people and the planet. Ideally, we would live in a world where this is easily attainable and possible, but this is not reality. I feel fortunate enough that these are problems I can be thinking about, and not focusing on obtaining basic necessities. I would hope to make a product with my project that is accessible to all, and not elitist or for the hands of few. I would hope that my project promotes desirable futures, and would hope that it is supported by people who share the same values as me.
