							 <h1>Module 1 20/1 & 27/1</h1>
							 <p>I was extremely excited to start this module led by Lara Campos. I had been waiting to do more in-depth biomaterials practice in the classroom setting. I enjoyed how we got technical information about the ingredients themselves that we were using and their properties.The projects and resources that Lara shared with us were really interesting and inspiring and made me realize again all of the things that could be done with new materials. It reaffirmed to me that I want to continue working in the material context during this masters. I feel it was important that we were asked to think about material properties because so often I am making the materials, but not necessarily thinking about the properties as much as I should be. When I’m making the materials, I need to think about the use, the time frame, lifecycle, and what function it needs to have. The class introduced me to the idea of bottom up material design vs. material driven design and the difference between the two. A material can evoke emotion, be technical, and functional, and that’s what I aim to do with the materials I produce.</p>

							 <p>In groups, we experimented making materials based on recipes given. I had previously only experimented with agar-agar, glycerine, and starches so I was happy to expand the materials and ingredients. I had been wanting to try using pine resin for a while, working in 3-D rather than flat sheets and see what types of more rigid things could be made that had a little more structure. Extruding the materials into long strings was really fun as I had always seen the jelly-like strings but never knew how they were made. I have to say, I was not super impressed with the way they dried extremely thin. However, I tested their strength and resistance and it was actually quite strong. Seeing the variety of materials my classmates and I all made was wonderful. The table full of colors, materials, and textures proved to me the breadth of materials that could exist. We all really enjoyed using the mica because of its colorful and shiny properties that added depth to the materials. I enjoyed being able to monitor all of the materials laid out on the table to see how they changed and dried over the week. I had only used trays for my own materials but I liked using the frames because they kept the material stretched and they remained largely even. It was fun to be able to have access to so many biomaterial ingredients all in one place and to see the different types of things to be made. I had to question again, however, how can these materials be made useful?</p>

							 <h1>Experimentation</h1>
							 <p>In my own material exploration and development, I knew I wanted to continue working with a 3-dimensional product. I wanted to try to create a little vase-like object to hold an air plant as a decorative element. I wanted to see if I could use the pine resin as a clay-like substance in some way, to be able to mold it with my hands into whichever shape I wanted. While attempting to do so in the mold I was using with the baking paper, I realized some limitations that pine resin had which would not allow it to be very useful in shaping. For one, it has to be managed when it is very hot because it dries and settles so quickly. I was kind of burning my fingers while trying to manipulate it into the shape I wanted. As well, pine resin is extremely sticky so it got kind of messy. While I liked using the pine resin and see it as having a lot of applications, I question its use on a big scale because it is not very practical. I also wonder how it could really be sustainable if it were used in large amounts because it is taking it from trees after all. I wanted to use food waste for the exploration with the pine resin so decided to use onion peels and orange rind. While making the mixture, I messed up and added too much food waste and had to adjust the quantities of resin and wax. The recipe I used was as follows: 12 grams onion peel, 45 grams resin, 5 grams carnauba wax, 30 grams orange peel, 15 ml alcohol.</p>

							 <p>The resulting piece that I made came out slightly better than I had expected, given it was compressed with my hands instead of a mold that it would fit into. It was pretty hard and seemed like it wouldn’t break too easily, but I didn’t want to test that out by breaking it. The next step in the biomaterials exploration for me is finding utility for the materials and thinking more intentionally about what properties I want whatever I’m making to have.</p>
