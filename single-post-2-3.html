							 <h1>Audrey Desjardins 1/17</h1>
							 <p>Audrey, design researcher, discussed with us her autobiographical design and how she began being interested in her design research work and what led her down that path. She had been actively involved in a project where she was building out a van and documenting it, a home technology on wheels as she described it. She posted videos on instructables which she said had reached a fairly large audience. It’s interesting to think about how a research project, which is seemingly done just with yourself or a small number of other people, has the potential to be much bigger than the project itself. This proves that documenting has a lot of power for the person doing the project, but beyond that all of the people that can gain access to it. As with so many self-driven design research projects, and like Audrey stated, the project of her van is always unfinished and constantly changing. One of the projects I like that she highlighted was called Soft Fading. The project had to do with fabric, lights, and shadows, observing how the sun faded a piece of cloth on a rotating cylinder depending on the time of day and year. The outcomes that Audrey discussed were interesting, from how they expected the piece of cloth to look to what presumptions and observations they had for why the cloth faded the way that it did. She also discussed a project called Baking Data. I found it quite funny that the project itself involved baking. She discussed how it was documented, and it reminded me of when we discussed documenting our own research during the living with your own ideas seminar, whether the way we were documenting was honest and truthful or not. By documenting in multiple ways, data and observation from research can be better triangulated. I appreciated the tips she gave us at the end of the session as well. Some of the most meaningful one for me were: continuously check in with yourself and others, set a timeframe (but be flexible), find co-conspirators, and our bodies are our research instruments.</p>

							 <h1>Laura Forlano 1/24</h1>
							 <p>I found the last tip of the first future talk, that our bodies are research instruments, the perfect segway to the topic for the following future talk. Laura’s project is entitled Automated: A Memoir for Design Otherwise. With it, she had a focus on living and experimenting with having diabetes, and documenting her experimentation and the effect it had on her. She called herself a human cyborg, because she lives with and has to interact with technology for her health every day. She discussed theories of the posthuman which I had never heard about before. One point she made that I found poignant that we should focus on asking more questions instead of just finding design solutions. It does make sense to ask questions, and more of them, before we jump to or focus on just finding solutions. In design studio the following week, we discussed the major talking points from Laura. These included the value of design theory and how they may be the future of design practice, tensions within the post-human turn, and collapse between the researcher and researched. I found the final point was the one that remained with me the most after Laura’s talk. Disabled people continue to be experimental subjects for AI systems. It raises the question; why are they not more involved in the design of the devices they need? Laura said that she found the greatest sense of community in how to use her devices with a page on Facebook. Design seems that it can be really removed from the groups of people that are part of the intended user group. People like Laura, living with a disability, should not have to experiment the way she is without having a strong impact with the input she is directly providing by using her own body as a test subject. I like how she positioned herself as part of the larger system and was able to see how important she could be in creating a new framework where designers can more frequently include the people that will directly be interacting with the output of designs.</p>
