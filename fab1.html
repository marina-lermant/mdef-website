							 <h1>Week 1: Principles and practices, project management</h1>
							 <p>This first week my classmates and I were really excited to finally start the Fab Academy we had heard so much about and were waiting to get into. The first classes were not quite as active as I had expected, but it made sense since it was just the introductory course. I was a bit confused at first about the difference between Fab Academy as an official class and with MDEF. There were some other students in the main hall with us that were going to be joining in for Fabacademy. The first lesson about getting set up with Git and how Git works was informative as a refresher of the semantics behind it. However, I wish that I had received more of this general overview when I started coding and using GitHub. If I had not been familiar with any of the coding experience from first term, I think I would have been very lost so it did feel nice to feel like I knew what was being talked about. I’m still a little confused about how MarkDown works and how we will be using it for our new repositories with each challenge we do. I had no idea what the first global class would be like. Our MDEF group chat was inundated with messages because we did not understand exactly what the assignments were or what was expected of us, but I think it is more clear now that we will be focusing on what the local Barcelona classes are assigning for us. I’m not sure if I’ve ever been a participant in a zoom call with that many people before. It was awesome to be able to see FabLabs from all over the world and see how it really is an interconnected network of so many people of different backgrounds, each learning in their own spaces and then coming together once a week to learn collectively through zoom.</p>

							 <p>This week’s task was to look through previous students’ websites and note the way they documented for Fabacademy. By looking at other websites for documentation, I was also browsing and reading through, which helped me grasp what concepts I will be digging into and learning about which made me scared but excited. One thing I liked was from  <a href="https://ines_burdiles.gitlab.io/sitio/fabacademy.html">Ines Burdile's website.</a> She broke up the weekly reflection in four different sections: facts, findings, feelings, and future. I think documenting like this was probably useful in helping Ines encompass the Fabacademy for herself and future readers as well. From <a href="https://paco_flores.gitlab.io/mdef-2021/">Paco Flores' site,</a> I noticed that he provided a link to all the github repositories that was highly visible. This made it easy for the viewer to view the documentation more in depth and also allow future students access to it if they needed. One thing I really liked from <a href= "https://morgane_shaban.gitlab.io/mdef/fabacademy.html">Morgan Shaban’s website</a>  was that she included initial and final questions. By opening up the beginning of the week like this and ending it with continued, but more developed and informed questions seems like a really good way of extending the week’s learnings. In the coming weeks I’d like to experiment with some of these ways of documenting as well as my own.  I’ll start today.</p>

							 <p>Key Takeaway: Git is so important in coding technologies because of it’s open source model, collaborative functionality, and keeping a log of changes.</p>
							 <p>Question: What is the difference between Git and Linux and which one is used when?</p>
							 <p>Moment of !: Realizing what a big community of people who are doing the same thing I was being connected to globally.</p>
