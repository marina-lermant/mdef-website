         		   <p>This hands-on workshop was about uncovering obsolete technology, both physically and theoretically, discussing why and how the technology was deemed obsolete. Out of various choices of old electronics and appliances, my group chose an old Macbook. We chose it because we felt that we all used our laptops so much every day that it would be interesting to see what was really inside making the machine work. Taking apart the laptop in its entirety took much longer than I thought. There are countless tiny parts and pieces to separate methodically from one another. The amount of tiny screws was insane. We also needed to use about 5 different tools to be able to get it all separated. By removing all the parts, I was able to see how much truly goes into the laptops, and gives me an appreciation for the design itself, as space needs to be extremely maximized. I wonder how much different the macbooks of today look than the one we dismantled from nearly 20 years ago. The supply chains and sourcing of the materials spans an area much larger than I could imagine, with so many pieces coming from countries such as Thailand, Japan, Mexico, Canada, etc. on top of it being designed in the United States. One of my favorite parts was taking apart the keyboard and ripping of the keys, seeing how many components and layers there were. Similarly, the screen had 6 layers, each with its own function. The most fun part was when we saw how the fiber optic lights worked to light the keyboard before there were small enough LEDs to fit behind individual keys. We shone a phone flashlight to the back of the bundle of strings and made our own little light show with it. The full forensic report can be seen at the link below.</p>

<p>Opening up, dissecting, and ultimately destroying the laptop also uncovered ways of thinking in the tech industry. For example, as soon as we fully popped the bottom casing off, a small piece of metal broke, indicating that we had tampered with it, therefore most likely voiding any warranty. This shows that companies, notably Apple, want full control over their products, making it hard for consumers to understand what product they really have. It has become harder and harder for individuals to fix electronics and appliances themselves, firstly because it is not really considered common knowledge and also that the industries design it to be that way. As consumers, what is our right to repair? Do we somehow give that up when we buy products from certain manufacturers which we know we won’t be able to fix? Unfortunately, that is the reason we often buy new products when maybe only one part is no longer functioning. Programmed obsolescence is a problem because it causes us to expect to only have the fastest, newest products, when they might not be necessary. While this allows companies to make more money, it creates tons of e-waste and of course is not sustainable. It puts consumers in a hard position because naturally people want to have the latest technology (an expectation also set by society), but also don’t have a choice in how long their tech might last, especially when it is designed to fail at some point. This, coupled with the fact that self-repair is nearly impossible, largely takes power completely out of the consumer’s hands.

							 <h1>Measuring the world</h1>
               <p>The second portion of the week entailed a 3 day mixed lecture-project based workshop involving obtaining and measuring data. We formed groups and set out to answer a question through data collection. My group including Roberto, Borka, Joaquin, Aparna, and George asked ourselves: why might some young people in Barcelona be lonely? With this question in mind, we made the conjecture that it could be due to the use of messaging and media apps taking the place of face-to-face interaction. Each group picked a tool to use after the process of a reverse auction. I liked the idea of the reverse auction, which I had never done before, because it made each group think of if or why they really wanted the tool they had in mind. To help answer our question, my group wanted the arduino with LDR sensors. We built the little machine and began testing. When a phone would light up under the table, the light sensors would show peaks and falls. Ultimately we used our sensor at Itnig in a kind of exemplary exercise to test our theory since given the parameters we wouldn’t have been able to do it another way. It was cool to be able to familiarize myself with our tool of choice and see how a simple tool with the LDR sensor could be used in so many different ways or used to answer questions and do research on practically any topic. Although long, I felt the presentations particularly interesting to see how each group used their tool and what kind of outcomes they got from it, including the ways they analyzed that data. The feedback we received was super helpful, and I appreciated how enthusiastic and excited Oscar, Guillem, and Victor were about teaching us. This led us into interesting discussions about the role of data, data safety, the manipulation of data, FAIR data, etc. Guillem brought up the thought that if you’re using a product for free, are you the product? It’s a slightly scary thing to think about. While I know and am conscious that data about myself and life is being extracted from me every day, I never really think about where it goes or what it’s being used for..</p>
