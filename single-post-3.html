         		   <p>This was an exciting week for me as I was looking forward to Biology zero on the schedule. On Monday, we started off with a design studio about research through design and prototyping. It’s interesting to think about researching by designing and how the process goes hand in hand. Research does not need to come first before design, but instead design can be a form of research in itself. I’ve always thought about prototyping meaning one thing, but learning about the different types of prototyping showed me that it can be done and represented in many different ways. I’ve always thought about prototyping as the first role: as an experimental component. Some types of prototyping I have done before, and some I have yet to try. Going through the different types made me realize that prototyping is part of my daily life in small ways as well as having done it through school projects. Since there is overlap in all the types of prototyping, it can be a bit hard to distinguish which type of prototyping category projects might fall into. By thinking about how prototyping can be done in different ways, it showed me any type of experimentation can be prototyping.</p>

							 <h1>My first mdef prototype</h1>
               <p>For my first prototyping design experiment, I knew I wanted to test out making a biomaterial. Since I had previously only made kombucha leather with the intention of making something for a textile, I wanted to experiment with bioplastics. Some of the mediums we created during the biology zero week contained agar-agar. I am very interested in algae for its material properties so I decided to make a bioplastic using it as a main ingredient. It took me quite a while to gather all of the materials I needed for the experiment, but once I had them all I quickly began experimenting. My apartment has been in the process of being furnished the past couple weeks, so there is tons and tons of cardboard from the boxes. I wanted to think about how it could be used or transformed into something new besides being thrown away or recycled to turn into another paper product. In order to do this, my thought process was to make a composite material. I wanted to try to make shapes with the plastic such as a small bowl. I added the cardboard pieces to a mixer to create a pulp which I squeezed dry and added to the agar-agar glycerin bioplastic mixture. I tried different versions using more or less cardboard or glycerine to see the difference in rigidity and density. The resulting bioplastic was much more gooey than I thought it would be, even the mixture that I didn’t add very much glycerine to. I think having it mold into a shape would be simple except that it would need to be done very quickly after the mixture was prepared as it started solidifying pretty quickly and therefore cracked when I tried to bend and shape it about 45 minutes after I poured it on a surface. The outcome didn’t go exactly as I had supposed it to, but then again I had never experimented making bioplastics and much less adding any other type of material into it. I think the components could have potential to act in the way I was imagining if I found the right ratio of materials and timing. Nevertheless, it was fun prototyping this first mini-project to see what types of materials can be made.</p>

							 <h1>Biology basics</h1>
							 <p>Learning about biology from “zero” was information intensive. Some of the concepts we were going through were definitely a few levels above zero, and I was having trouble understanding all of the relationships and processes when I do not have the breadth of knowledge at a scientific level. It was useful to have Nuria speak at a very scientific level and then Jonathan relay that information in a different way. I had definitely learned about most of the concepts we talked about at a basic level, but it has been years or I had been learning about them in a different context. It makes sense that a crash course about biology as a whole in a few days would be hard to do but it did get me into a different mindset.</p>

							 <h1>activities</h1>
							 <p>What I enjoyed most about the week was hands-on application sessions in the afternoon. We started by making substrates to inoculate microbes and bacteria. My group made a do-it-yourself yeast medium. I took swabs of the IAAC door handle, my saliva, and Tatiana’s arm to see what would procure after inoculation.

One activity that was more familiar to me was when we were playing with growing materials. Though I had never practiced growing spirulina, I knew about its superfood abilities and how nutrition dense it is. I like mixing it into smoothies but would like to taste it fresh as well. I had previously grown my own kombucha culture biomaterial leather but I love doing it so I was excited when we got to try it out as a class. I want to learn more about different possibilities for biomaterials which is something I think we will discuss more in the coming term, as well as me doing my own research to become more knowledgeable.

I particularly enjoyed the day we got to play with microscopes. It’s always cool to see “average”, everyday things such as a leaf or skin up close and see them in a new light. I think as designers, we tend to think in more of a big picture mindset so switching that up felt really good by examining things at a much smaller scale.
