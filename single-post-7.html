         		   <h1>Almost Useless Machines</h1>
         			    <div class="post-format">

					       </div>
         		   <p>So I’m starting to understand more of what the whole “myth” is in tech beyond the myth. I also see how little I actually know about technology at its core. I grew up in the Silicon Valley in California, surrounded by tech with apple and google offices being my neighbors. However familiar I am being around the techy atmosphere, I still don’t know much about technology’s inside parts. This week of almost useless machines helped me figure that out a bit more. We were tasked with making machines that have no real use outside of the one that we give it. After forming groups, we started brainstorming ideas for the machine. We thought of 3 quick concepts, all based on certain emotions. I think this was an interesting way to go about thinking of concepts because it forces the machine to give off some type of sentiment, therefore injecting some human aspect into the machine. We chose the feeling of *almost* getting a hug. A feeling that drew up a lot of potential emotions, from anticipation, anxiety, trust, desperation, etc.</p>
							 <br>

							 <p>I would say the group worked together very well. We didn’t have much time to build the machine, even though 3 days might somehow seem like a lot. We would stop and meet to discuss what problems were happening, and how we might solve them. There were so many different small steps to think about along the way which could not be foreseen until we were in the midst of making it. Problem-solving was happening throughout which I enjoyed.</p>
<br>

							<p>After the first day of the almost useless machines, I felt quite down. It was a long day and I was stressed, and I felt almost useless myself. I felt I couldn’t contribute to my group nearly enough, or in the way that I wanted to. I wish that I had more I could help with, more knowledge to share, input to give, or help more with the tasks we needed to do in order to actually construct the machine. It was hard for me to feel like this because even though I’m not usually the person to be the team leader, I hate feeling like I’m not contributing to a group effort. As the week went on, I tried to change my mindset and keep a positive attitude. Attitude is always something you can control and I needed to remind myself of that, because it could really help make a difference in the long days. My group members Fiorella, Anna, Didac, Paula, and Rei were really nice to work with. We didn’t chat as much as in other group projects because we were very busy trying to get everything done in time.

<br>

<p>As the machine started coming to life, I got more and more excited. The fabrication process was the most fun as that was when the machine took its form. I worked on some of the electronics with Anna and got help from Victor about the wiring. I appreciate how calm he is and explain things very well. I was also next to them during the first part of the coding process. Though I didn’t code it directly, I think it helped me get a little more well-versed with the ideas of how to code instructions, based on the flowchart we made. I would have liked to spend even more time watching and learning from them, but I didn’t feel the best use of time for the group as a whole would be from me observing them. This week I realized how much I can learn from focused observation in conjunction with trying things myself. I hope to not let fear of the unknown control me as I feel that is something I’ll be battling with throughout the course.</p>
<br>

<p>The almost useless machines was an intense week of long days, where I felt lost and overwhelmed at times, wanting to do and be more but feeling like I couldn’t. However, in the end I felt proud of myself, the group, and our little big hug me (or not) machine. I learned a lot, and think the exercise/workshop was an excellent way to practice these skills in a way that has a minimalist approach, not trying to do anything other than what we have decided.</p>

							 <h1>My first mdef prototype</h1>
               <p>For my first prototyping design experiment, I knew I wanted to test out making a biomaterial. Since I had previously only made kombucha leather with the intention of making something for a textile, I wanted to experiment with bioplastics. Some of the mediums we created during the biology zero week contained agar-agar. I am very interested in algae for its material properties so I decided to make a bioplastic using it as a main ingredient. It took me quite a while to gather all of the materials I needed for the experiment, but once I had them all I quickly began experimenting. My apartment has been in the process of being furnished the past couple weeks, so there is tons and tons of cardboard from the boxes. I wanted to think about how it could be used or transformed into something new besides being thrown away or recycled to turn into another paper product. In order to do this, my thought process was to make a composite material. I wanted to try to make shapes with the plastic such as a small bowl. I added the cardboard pieces to a mixer to create a pulp which I squeezed dry and added to the agar-agar glycerin bioplastic mixture. I tried different versions using more or less cardboard or glycerine to see the difference in rigidity and density. The resulting bioplastic was much more gooey than I thought it would be, even the mixture that I didn’t add very much glycerine to. I think having it mold into a shape would be simple except that it would need to be done very quickly after the mixture was prepared as it started solidifying pretty quickly and therefore cracked when I tried to bend and shape it about 45 minutes after I poured it on a surface. The outcome didn’t go exactly as I had supposed it to, but then again I had never experimented making bioplastics and much less adding any other type of material into it. I think the components could have potential to act in the way I was imagining if I found the right ratio of materials and timing. Nevertheless, it was fun prototyping this first mini-project to see what types of materials can be made.</p>

							 <h1>Biology basics</h1>
							 <p>Learning about biology from “zero” was information intensive. Some of the concepts we were going through were definitely a few levels above zero, and I was having trouble understanding all of the relationships and processes when I do not have the breadth of knowledge at a scientific level. It was useful to have Nuria speak at a very scientific level and then Jonathan relay that information in a different way. I had definitely learned about most of the concepts we talked about at a basic level, but it has been years or I had been learning about them in a different context. It makes sense that a crash course about biology as a whole in a few days would be hard to do but it did get me into a different mindset.</p>

							 <h1>activities</h1>
							 <p>What I enjoyed most about the week was hands-on application sessions in the afternoon. We started by making substrates to inoculate microbes and bacteria. My group made a do-it-yourself yeast medium. I took swabs of the IAAC door handle, my saliva, and Tatiana’s arm to see what would procure after inoculation.

One activity that was more familiar to me was when we were playing with growing materials. Though I had never practiced growing spirulina, I knew about its superfood abilities and how nutrition dense it is. I like mixing it into smoothies but would like to taste it fresh as well. I had previously grown my own kombucha culture biomaterial leather but I love doing it so I was excited when we got to try it out as a class. I want to learn more about different possibilities for biomaterials which is something I think we will discuss more in the coming term, as well as me doing my own research to become more knowledgeable.

I particularly enjoyed the day we got to play with microscopes. It’s always cool to see “average”, everyday things such as a leaf or skin up close and see them in a new light. I think as designers, we tend to think in more of a big picture mindset so switching that up felt really good by examining things at a much smaller scale.
